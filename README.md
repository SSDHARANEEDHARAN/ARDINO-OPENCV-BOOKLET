## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

* **Arduino IDE**: [Download here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* **OpenCV**: [Installation Guide](https://opencv.org/releases/)
* **Python 3.x**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Arduino Hardware**: Depending on the project (Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.), see individual project requirements.
* **Webcam/Camera Module**: For most computer vision projects.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-opencv-projects.git
   cd arduino-opencv-projects
   ```

2. **Install OpenCV** (if not installed):

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. **Upload Arduino Code**: Open the `.ino` files in the Arduino IDE and upload to your board.

4. **Run OpenCV Scripts**: Use the provided Python scripts for your computer vision tasks.
